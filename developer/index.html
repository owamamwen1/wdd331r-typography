      <h2>Installing Third-Party Applications</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to install a third-party or custom application, it's
        logical to place it in the <p3>/usr/local/appname</p3> directory,
        possibly with a link to the program binary in the
        <p3>/usr/local/bin</p3> directory. Keep in mind that if you have a
        choice between putting the software package in the /usr/local/bigprog
        section and the <p3>/opt/bigprog</p3> section, the /opt section is not
        considered to be sharable, whereas the /usr section is often shared
        and mounted by client systems.
      </p>

          If given a choice between putting the software package
          <p4>BIGPROG</p4> in the <p3>/usr/local/<p4>BIGPROG</p4>
          </p3> section
          and the <p3>/opt/<p4>BIGPROG</p4>
          </p3> section, it's hard to choose.
          Read any relevant exam question closely--the main difference being
          that the <p3>/opt</p3> section is not considered to be sharable,
          whereas the <p3>/usr</p3> section is often shared and mounted by
          client systems.

      <h2>File Management Commands</h2>
      <p>
        A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands
        properly with the right options and arguments. As a good sysadmin,
        you'll be expected to know how to create, delete, edit, set
        permissions on, display, move, copy, and determine the type of files
        and programs.

              border="0" /></a></span>
        <p class="mono">
          You must be able to pick proper and working commands out of lists of
          possibilities, type in appropriate strings in fill-in-the-blank
          boxes, and in general show that you've run the programs and
          utilities in question.

      <h2>Tips for working with Linux files</h2>
      <p>
        Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS
        background, a quick set of recommendations for the less-experienced
        can be of help here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="li-firstLine">Hidden files aren't really hidden -
          </span>
          They just begin with a ., such as the <p3>.bashrc</p3> and
          <p3>.bash_profile</p3> files. These are not viewable by normal users
          with conventional commands and switches and aren't deleted by
          commands such as <p3>rm -f *.*</p3>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="li-firstLine">Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters -
          </span>
          The filenames <p3>this.is.a.long.file</p3> and
          <p3>thisisalongfile</p3> are perfectly reasonable and possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="li-firstLine">Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type -
          </span>
          Use an _ or a - instead of spaces because it's neater and easier
          than prefixing all spaces with a \. (To display a space in a
          filename, the system shows a space prefixes with a backslash.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="li-firstLine">File permissions are crucial - </span>
          Understand the basic concepts of file permissions and ownership. Use
          the chmod command to set file permissions and the chown command to
          change file ownership.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="li-firstLine">Use relative and absolute paths - </span>
          When navigating the Linux filesystem, you can use both relative and
          absolute paths. Relative paths start from the current directory,
          while absolute paths start from the root directory.
        </li>
      </ul>
